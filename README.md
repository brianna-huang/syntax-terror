## Syntax Terror

Our web application is motivated by the universal love for movies! It challenges film lovers with a game feature to test their knowledge of movies, actors, and directors. To provide a tailored experience to each user, the site also includes movie information and recommendations.

NOTE: we are using the template for Swiftify (HW #2) provided to us by our instructors. 

To install dependencies, run:

```
cd server
npm install
````

And repeat in the client directory. 

Then connect to a database, by entering host information in  `config.json` in the server directory.

Then launch the application: 
```
npm start
```
Run from the **server** directory from a terminal window, and from the **client** directory from a separate terminal window. This should automatically launch the localhost.
